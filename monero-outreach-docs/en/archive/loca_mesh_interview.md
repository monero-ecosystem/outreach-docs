# Interview with Randy Brito of Locha Mesh

In February 2020 the Monero community took a chance on the [Locha Mesh](https://github.com/btcven/locha#readme) project, by funding a proposal submitted to [Monero’s Community Crowdfunding System](https://ccs.getmonero.org/) (CCS). The CCS is a platform for Monero contributors, and sometimes aligned projects, to submit an idea or proposal for funding. Usually proposals are directly related to Monero development, so the Locha Mesh proposal caught quite a few people by surprise.  

Locha Mesh is an open-source hardware and software project that is developing a protocol and devices to support off-grid cryptocurrency transactions. Led by Randy Brito and the Bitcoin Venezuela organization, this project demonstrated the ethos of innovation, privacy, and free and open source technology that align so well with Monero. As a result, the community donated to support them for three months and to produce greater documentation that will make it easier for the respective Monero and Locha Mesh developers to work together, demonstrate successful sending of messages over the Locha Mesh, and ultimately allow syncing a Monero node over the Locha Mesh network—perhaps using Monero’s innovative [RPC-Pay](https://www.monerooutreach.org/stories/RPC-Pay.html) feature to incentize Locha Mesh node operators.  

We had the chance to speak with Randy Brito about Locha Mesh and its involvement with Monero, and are eager to share this conversation with the world.  

**Thanks for agreeing to have this discussion, Randy. And congratulations on the recent support from the Monero Community! To start off, what would you like to say to everyone who donated XMR in support of your CCS proposal?**  

_Randy Brito:_ The Locha Mesh team wants to thank every backer who has contributed to our Monero CCS proposal, and also all the members of the community who have participated in the discussions. We are looking forward to working with the community to make Monero even better.  

**Many among the Monero community seem to be Bitcoin converts who recognized the inherent flaws of a transparent blockchain, particularly as it relates to fungibility and the properties of money. What sort of things have you done to support Monero over the years?**  

_Randy Brito:_ I’ve tested wallets myself (MyMonero web wallet, CakeWallet, MoneroGUI, MyMonero desktop app) and reported issues I may have found in the UX. I’ve also recommended using Monero to tens of thousands of people in [BitcoinVenezuela.com](https://www.bitcoinvenezuela.com/) facebook groups for preserving their privacy and as a way to anonymize the Bitcoins they’ve acquired from other members to unlink their identity from past and future transactions. Bitcoin Venezuela’s Bolivars (VES) price API has had XMR/VES pairs for years, and it is used by some wallets (e.g. CakeWallet) to retrieve the latest free market price for Monero in Venezuelan Bolivars.  

In 2016 I defended Monero in front of 260 people in the Free Market Road Show as a way to avoid situations like the Falciani Swiss banks fiasco through the privacy and anonymity features of Monero. The talk was about Bitcoin as the uncensorable digital gold.  

I also defended both Bitcoin and Monero in coffee chats with Liberty Fund and Austrian Economic Center members. Many Students For Liberty members all around the world have benefited from these discussions due to their scepticism and the need to start thinking outside of the traditional gold standard and monetary/banking theories.  

Libertarians, economists, and many others throughout the years have had the patience to listen to me and many others explaining Bitcoin and Monero as the only way to fight governments’ attempts to implement 1984.  

Looking to the future, the Locha Mesh will enable real anonymous transactions for Monero by allowing completely off-grid broadcast of transactions and block sync over a resilient and private decentralized mesh network. It will even enable the possibility of incentivizing Monero node operators to provide services to others through the new RPC-Pay feature in Monero.  

**Thank you for doing the hard work of advocating for Monero in real life through your professional activities. That’s more than a lot of us can say. The next question might be a little more difficult. Some in the Monero community were critical of your proposal, what would you like to say to them?**  

_Randy Brito:_ I want them to know that I believe in and have followed Monero development and supported it throughout all these years in every opportunity as I mentioned. I hope they will see the work we’ve put on the Locha Mesh to bring it into reality to make Bitcoin and Monero more resilient and give them the power to overcome the difficulties that will arise in the times to come. With the added support of the Monero community now, I’m sure together we will demonstrate the importance of this collaboration. I invite all Monero contributors to take a closer look at Locha Mesh and join us in the efforts.  

**We too love to see collaboration among like-minded projects. Hopefully your goals are achieved and we all win! Another tough question… There’s been some confusion about your intentions due to the for-profit business side of Locha Mesh, would you please explain how and why you’ve structured the business and software/hardware licensing as you have?**  

_Randy Brito:_ Locha Mesh is an open-source software and open-source hardware project that anyone can join and support. In Dec 2018-Jan 2019 we did not receive as many Bitcoin donations as we hoped in the campaign we ran through the non-profit organization Bitcoin Venezuela. The campaign was meant to fund the development costs of the Locha Mesh.  

As we needed to hire developers full-time to be able to advance the project, we decided to turn the design we had of the “off-the-shelf DIY version” of the Turpial hardware into a single board product that could be sold in order to raise funds from investors to fund the open-source software and hardware development. With that, “Locha, the hardware company” (we’re planning to rename it to Turpial Tech to avoid this confusion) was born and we raised some funds from Bitcoin OGs and other pre-seed investors who believed in the Locha Mesh and its urgency.  

Since the start of Q3 2019, [Turpial Tech](https://turpial.io/) has subsidized the cost of Locha Mesh open-source development, one full-time mobile app developer, two full-time core developers, and the main Locha Mesh core developer who receives no salary from Locha Mesh, but has been leading the development since 2018 (he is also the CTO of Turpial Tech).  

While I have an audience I’d like to add: if there is anyone with ideas on how to make the Locha Mesh project sustainable without having to depend for the most part on money raised from investors, please feel free to contact us. Let’s find a way to make the Locha Mesh an open-source community-funded project.  

The funds donated by Turpial Tech, the Monero Community, funds collected from other donations through the GitHub Sponsors, Bitcoin addresses, and grants, these are all managed by the non-profit Bitcoin Venezuela, which has been doing education, promotion, humanitarian aid, and also open-source code development since 2012.  

**Thank you for clearing that confusion up for us. Do you plan to become more involved in the Monero community? If so, why and in what capacity?**  

_Randy Brito:_ The Monero Community will need to get used to seeing me (also the Locha Mesh team and contributors) around more regularly. We’ll look into the integration of the Locha Mesh network with the Monero GUI wallet, along the lines of what is being developed for SOCKS, Tor, and i2p. Through our testing of the RPC-Pay feature we can provide good feedback to Monero devs and demonstrate an innovative use case.  

Also, after completing the milestones of the CCS proposal, we’d like to hear from the community on the next steps they can identify for the Locha Mesh to continue enhancing Monero’s key features. In the proposal discussion someone mentioned the possibility of the Locha Mesh becoming an exclusive Monero project, which is a topic I think would be great for more discussion.  

**Thank you. Just a few questions left for you. Thinking about the future, what do you see as the most exciting technological possibility of combining Monero and Locha Mesh?**  

_Randy Brito:_ Adding native Tor and i2p support to Monero nodes and wallets is needed, but it is very important to also add support to a censorship-resistant alternative communication system like the Locha Mesh. The former options currently still depend on an Internet connection, which today is linked to your identity in some way. I’m really excited about enabling thousands of currently-disconnected-from-the-Internet computers to be part of an RPC-Pay economy as a way for people to trade their hashing power for services like gateways, transaction push services, full-node operations for light-weight wallets, and wallet services for off-grid users.  

**That would be a dream come true. Last question. If people are interested, what can Monero community members do to support the development of Locha Mesh and possible integration of Monero technologies?**  

_Randy Brito:_ The Locha Mesh is an open-source project. All are invited to come to the [Telegram group](https://t.me/Locha_io) and the [GitHub repos](https://github.com/btcven/locha) to participate in the development: software development, reviewing Pull Requests, helping with documentation, translating, proof reading, contributing to the open-source hardware development, and testing the devices in the wild to suggest improvements or identify issues. All these areas could use help and any volunteer is welcome!  

**All right, great. Thanks so much Randy. We hope this fun experiment will be a great benefit to all!**  

_Randy Brito:_ Thank you. And thank you to the Monero community! We look forward to working more closely with this project.
