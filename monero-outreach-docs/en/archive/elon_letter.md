# Letter to Elon Musk

**“The Monero Community would like a word.” - 9th of February, 2021**

### _Dear Elon_,

Monero is the largest and most popular privacy-preserving cryptocurrency. Today a group from the Monero community raised enough XMR to purchase three Tesla Model 3s and they intend to donate them to three 501(c)3 nonprofit organizations; were you to enable Monero (XMR) payments on the Tesla website. According to the community group, this proposal is open to your response for 21 days.

This comes shortly after the cryptocurrency ecosystem welcomed your announcement of Tesla adding $1.5 billion in Bitcoin to their balance sheet and the intention to accept Bitcoin payment for Tesla vehicles.

With the Monero community attracting cypherpunks from around the globe, there is little more you could do to live up to your reputation than to accept the most cypherpunk money in existence. They assert that using Monero would protect future Tesla owners because Bitcoin payments are traceable and could reveal large quantities linked to private identities. Monero on the other hand, eliminates that risk and enables truly private transactions.

Let’s see if you can appreciate the cypherpunk project that attracts [the third most developers of all cryptocurrencies](https://www.monerooutreach.org/stories/why-monero-attracts-dev-talent.html). And hey, if you can then we’ll also be able to see a few public charities benefit from receiving your beautiful Model 3s!

Sincerely yours,
Monero Outreach

### _P.S. From the Monero community Group:_

Monero is the largest cryptocurrency that allows you to buy goods and services without exposing your entire finances to large corporations, foreign governments, and everyone else on the internet.

It promotes human rights, protecting those with the most to lose -- such as journalists or citizens under oppressive regimes. It is totally decentralized and run by a passionate community, not corporations or “foundations”.

It is the ultimate cypherpunk currency.

The Monero community group has crowdfunded enough XMR to buy three Tesla Model 3 cars. If Tesla adds support to buy its cars with Monero, these cars will be given away to non-profit organizations that can use them to help others.
