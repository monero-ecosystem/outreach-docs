# The Tool for Renewal
**“Participate in a movement for positive change with a tool that gives social and economic power back to the people: Monero.”**
8th of June, 2020

The year is 2020, and we are watching a multifaceted crisis unfold. We have a global pandemic, the resurfacing of racial and economic tensions, extreme geopolitical division, and the abuse of power by governments and central banks around the world. We have, history tells us, the ingredients for transformative change. If you support or are among those being oppressed for racial, religious, political, or economic reasons, we invite you to participate in a movement for positive change with a tool that gives social and economic power back to the people: Monero.

Civil unrest and dysfunction is often the precursor to profound change. Riots in ancient Rome presaged stages of the end of the republic. In America, independence came after protest, property damage, and violent responses by authorities against protesters (such as in the Boston Massacre). Protest and civil disobedience accompanied strong civil rights changes starting in the 1960s.

Financial systems are often inextricably linked to civil unrest and social change. The foundations of the American Revolutionary War included the colonial desire to control taxation and economic destiny.

As central banks began to print money after the complete dismantling of the gold standard in 1971, a new fiat system (US Dollar) was born that would become the global monetary peg, determining the value of most other currencies. People are now seeing the unintended consequences of this financial system, namely socio-economic fragility, inequity, and disparity. They want something better that balances the power. This time we do not need a revolutionary war to achieve it, though. We can simply opt out peacefully by choosing to use a technological financial system that is being built by and for the people.

In 2009 a pseudonymous person or group named Satoshi Nakamoto launched Monero’s precursor Bitcoin on the heals of the great financial collapse. In the genesis block, the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain, Satoshi entered a contemporary news headline to prove the timing of Bitcoin’s creation. It read, “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” This original message resonates today, as central banks seek to prop up the beleaguered global economy.

Bitcoin was created as money for the people, addressing the deep flaws created by the central, fractional reserve, fiat banking system that dominated our global economy throughout the 20th century. Bitcoin was created to provide a new paradigm where people store and manage their own money without trusting unworthy third parties. Those third parties, the banks, had profited enough from us. The 20th century was theirs. The innovation of the Bitcoin blockchain gave the promise that the 21st century would be ours.

However, being brand new, Bitcoin had technical flaws, including poor privacy. And so another pseudonymous person or group by the name of Nicolas van Saberhagen developed the CryptoNote protocol. Developers took notice and Monero was born. Monero solved many of Bitcoin’s issues, including its being easily surveilled by companies and governments. As blockchain analytics company Chainalysis recently stated in a public webinar, [chainalysis.com/.../Advanced-Obfuscation-Techniques-Public-Webinar.mp4](https://go.chainalysis.com/rs/503-FAP-074/images/Advanced-Obfuscation-Techniques-Public-Webinar.mp4), “Monero is a lot more privacy focused than its counterparts...Everything in Monero is obfuscated, you can’t distinguish anything.”

Monero is completely open source and has one of the most active and widespread communities of any cryptocurrency. The community has gained a reputation for an ethos that supports self-determination, individual sovereignty, and the protection of human rights. If you are looking for a system that can take power from corrupt governments and central bankers—and ultimately improve how people interact and transact with one another—we invite you to use Monero.

When a transaction is made using Monero, the sender, the receiver, and the amount are all hidden using cryptography, preventing governments, companies, and others from seeing and recording your actions. With Monero, individual buying and selling gets the privacy protection you expect for personal activities in your own home. Mathematics and open-source software protect you, not banks, the legal system, or the police.

Whether you need to move your money into a private, digital store of value out of necessity or you want to participate on principle to opt out of the current financial system, join us. Together, we can use new technology to limit the intrusion of corrupt bankers and governments, and participate in a financial system that empowers the people. We are all in this together. Let us use these tools to be the change we want to see in the world, for us and our future generations.

We do not expect you to take our word for any of this and encourage you to do your own research and check with sources. We will share some recommended starting points here. Once you have finished researching, please come back for the quick guide on how to get started using Monero (see below).

### _Acquiring Monero_

**Wallet.** To begin acquiring and using Monero, you must have a Monero wallet. There are many options for Monero wallets and they range from factors like ease of use, security, and portability. We at Monero Outreach have created a straightforward [guide for you to learn more and get started with a Monero wallet](https://www.monerooutreach.org/stories/monero_wallet_quickstart.html).

### _Use Monero to Change the World_

If you’ve made it this far, you likely sense as we do that Monero has the power to change the world for the better. It is important to understand that Monero is a volunteer-led, open-source community. If you feel drawn to pay it forward by contributing your time, talent, or wealth to safeguard your future, [learn how you can get started helping Monero](https://www.monerooutreach.org/stories/getting-started-helping-monero.html).

In a world full of uncertainty, we have the responsibility to fight for tools that let us live free from oppression. The only way we can find true peace is when we’ve empowered ourselves to break free from the grip of oppressive governments and central banks and unite as people who want to live freely. Until we take charge of our own future and regain our financial and social independence, there will be no justice, and there will be no peace.

Know justice. Know peace. Know that Monero will safeguard our human right to privacy and freedom.
