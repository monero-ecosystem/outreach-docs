# Stellumo - Monero Blockchain Fractal Art

Stellumo | 07/11/18 Stellumo renders the Monero blockchain as fractal art.

Further down the rabbit hole we go as we look at how Stellumo represents the entire Monero blockchain as fractal art. Be sure to visit their github page [github.com/monero-ecosystem/Stellumo](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/Stellumo) to give them some love and see more of their images. Now, without further ado, we'll leave you with Stellumo and Lewis Carroll to see the blockchain in a whole new way.

## *“Oh, that’s the name of the song, is it?” Alice said, trying to feel interested.*

## *“No, you don’t understand,” the Knight said, looking a little vexed.*

## *“That’s what the name is called.”*
