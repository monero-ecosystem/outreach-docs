# Seek To Learn More

As of the time of this writing, common assumptions say a vast majority of the Monero community consists of early adopters who are more technologically savvy than an average layperson. Monero code has been worked on by a few hundred developers, which is many more than most crypto projects can claim. Some speculate one reason Monero price has not grown closer to Bitcoin is because the technology behind Monero is hard for laypeople to understand and appreciate. But we early-adopters continue to march forward in hopes of Monero becoming more widely recognized and adopted. Monero 100 years from now will still depend upon people, people like you, working to safeguard its ecosystem and advancing the code even further. These are all reasons why we recommend people should always seek to learn more, especially if you’re not a developer. You can strengthen your ‘Monero literacy’ by consuming as much information as you can.

By learning more about Monero’s features, the code, the open-source cypherpunk ethos that started it, and ways to improve security and privacy while using it, together we can make the Monero ecosystem even stronger. By having a strong grasp on all the aspects of Monero, you will also be able to speak to others about it and help drive greater adoption. You will feel more comfortable and confident while storing, using, and transacting XMR. Knowledge is power and it can change the world. Always seek to learn more… and do your own research!
