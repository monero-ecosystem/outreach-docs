# Your Privacy

**“The caged bird sings with a fearful trill, of things unknown, but longed for still, and his tune is heard on the distant hill, for the caged bird sings of freedom.” - Maya Angelou - 4th of January, 2021**

With many privacy policies written to confound and discourage being read, we’re glad for the opportunity to talk about your privacy and our responsibility to it. This is Monero after all, and we should practice what we preach.

TLDR: Our site stores as little data as possible, for the shortest amount of time possible, in the most secure way possible. We won’t share your data with anyone for profit, but if it’s on a server, consider it public.

**Third Parties**  
Third party web services diminish your privacy, so we’re loathe to use them. The one exception is that we use services from Mapbox, Inc. and Mapbox International, Inc. to provide map tiles. Our maps are off by default; if you enable, MapBox would have your identifying metadata from our pages that contain maps. We’ll clearly label every instance on our site where a third-party will see your metadata and give you a chance to avoid it. If we ever use another third-party service, we’ll disclose it here.

**Cookies**  
We have an opt-in cookie that stores a generated ID. This ID stores your site preferences on our server. It’s optional, it’s meant simply to make our site easier for you to use.

**Tracking/Reporting**  
Our site tracks page visits and stores it on our server. We do not store your IP address; we sanitize your User Agent string and store just your browser type and general screen size. You’re scrubbed and we get some stats to help improve our efforts.

**Contact/Contribute Form**  
The data you provide when messaging us through the site is stored on our server and then expunged once received/answered. If we must keep it for reference, we’ll store the message offline.

**All Other Data on the Site**  
Any time we have to ask you for any information all the same precautions as above will be taken. Each form will be clear in what data is being stored and how it will be used.

**Updates & Notifications**  
Any changes to what we’re doing will be posted here. This page was updated at 1609798950 (Unix Epoch) and we’ve never been issued a subpoena, been forced to comply with any government agency on the planet and are not currently under any gag order.
