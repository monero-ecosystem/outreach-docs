# How to contribute

**What do we do?**

Education and communications around the value of Monero. This involves writing, creating educational material, and completing other general Monero tasks.

**Join one of our chats and introduce yourself:**
- What part of the world are you from?
- Any other involvements in the crypto space?
- What you would love to get suck in with?

Our main chat is on WIRE and we don't have a invite link for that.
